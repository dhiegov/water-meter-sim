## water meter simulator

A first experience with requirement analysis before starting the subject
of design patterns per se.

The project is a water flow meter simulator fictionally meant for the
water utility company [CAGEPA][1], as a supporting tool for other
software systems to consume without relying on actual video footage
from a working installed water meter.

The meter needs to functions continuously and non-stop, updating
its image when the cubic meter counter changes or at an interval
specified in a configuration file.

To make the [class diagram][4] ([source][5]), [planttext][2] was used, using the
[PlantUML language][3].
